PREFACE

FOR some long time past it has been widely felt
that a reduction in the cost os Classical Works
⁴ used in 'schools generally, and more especially in
those intended for boys of the middle classes, is
at once desirable and not difficult of accomplish-
ment. For the most part only portions os authors
are read in the earlier stages of education‚ and a
pupil is taken, from one work to another in each
successive hali-year or tenn; so that a book
needlessly large and proportionably expensive is
laid aside after a short and but partial use.

In order, thereiore‚ to meet what is certainly a
want, Portions of the Classical Writers usually
read in Schools are now being issued under the
title of GRAMMAR senoor‘rnxrs; while, at the
request os various Masters, it has been deterrnined
to add to the series some portions os the Greek
Testament.

Each ΤΕΧΤ is provided with a VOCABULARY os
the words occurring in it. In every instance—with
the exception os Eutropius and AEsop-the origin
os a word, when known, is stated at the commence-
ment of the article treating of it, is connectedwhh
